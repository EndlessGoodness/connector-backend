## 🔧 **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Socket.io Configuration**
```javascript
// CORS configuration for cross-origin support
io = socketIO(server, {
    cors: {
        origin: ["http://localhost:3000", "http://localhost:5173"],
        methods: ["GET", "POST"],
        credentials: true
    }
});
```

### **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Message table for real-time messaging
CREATE TABLE message (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT,
    "imageUrl" TEXT,
    "senderId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "receiverId" TEXT NOT NULL,
    "createdAt" TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    "updatedAt" TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### **Key Events Implemented**
- `connection` - Client connection established
- `joinRoom` - User joins a specific room
- `sendMessage` - Send message to another user
- `receiveMessage` - Receive message from another user
- `subscribeToNotifications` - Subscribe to notification channel
- `disconnect` - Client disconnection
